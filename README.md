The Tax Document Reader Application is an advanced cloud-based 
software specifically designed to streamline the data extraction process from 
tax file documents and efficiently store the extracted information in a 
database. Its primary objective is to simplify and expedite tax file processing 
for government organisations, facilitating accurate data for calculations of 
individual taxes for taxpayers.

The users of the application are organisations who need to process the tax 
documents and performance targets for the application include fast and 
accurate data extraction, secure storage of sensitive tax information, and 
seamless retrieval of the data based on the user's email address and 
automate the process of sending emails to users whose email addresses 
are extracted from the uploaded tax documents, ensuring that they receive 
relevant notifications whenever any requirements arise.
